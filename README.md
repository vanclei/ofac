# ofac

Symfony files that deal with the Business Rules for Ofac List (Office of Foreign Assets Control), that is a list of people carries out its activities against foreign states as well as a variety of problematic organizations and individuals deemed to be a threat to U.S. national security.

They are just example files and they are not a complete solution.  The objective is to analise the code style.
